            <h1>Climate Target Modernization Testimony</h1>
            <p>Thank you for the opportunity to comment on SB1559, which I strongly support.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>As the father of a young son, I have worked hard to understand the climate crisis and how it will affect
              his future. What I have learned is almost too terrible to bear: that we have leveraged the long-term
              prosperity of our entire civilization and the ecosystems upon which it depends for short-term economic
              growth and convenience.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Our children deserve to grow up with the prospect of a hopeful future ahead. They can only do this if
              they see us moving as dramatically and as swiftly as possible toward total decarbonization. Aligning the
              state's greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals with this reality, as SB1559 would do, is a foundational
              step toward taking that necessary action. It enables us to hold ourselves accountable to the generations
              that will inherit the world we leave them.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I encourage you to support this bill. Further, I ask that you become similarly alarmed by this danger, if
              you are not already, and that you expand your imagination for what action is possible beyond what is
              currently politically feasible.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>Noah Langenwalter</p>
